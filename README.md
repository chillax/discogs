Discogs
=====

A small proof of concept Android application. Fetches data from Discogs.com REST API (mainly the user's profile, record collection and data about records). Utilizes RoboSpice (for async), Scribe (for oauth 1.0a) and Jackson (for json parsing).

I might continue working on this in the future.
